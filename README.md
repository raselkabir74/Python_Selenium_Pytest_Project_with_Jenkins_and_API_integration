# RTB UI tests

We need to cover our DSP Dashboard system flows with selenium tests.

This is a test project written in `python3`.

To run this first clone this repo in your machine. Create a virtual environment with `venv`. Give these following
commands to setup the environment:

```
$python3 -m venv venv
$source venv/bin/activate
$pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Local Debugging (Terminal)

Clone this repository and navigate to the root directory of the test UI automation project.
Create your local configuration file:

```
$cp local.ini.dist local.ini
```

Edit `local.ini` with the necessary information:

```
[credential]
username = AutomationAdminUser
password = Provide the user password
url = https://dsp-stage.eskimi.com
prod-url = https://dsp.eskimi.com
user-id = Provide test user id
api-url = https://{}.eskimi.com/
prod-api-url = https://{}.eskimi.com/
client-id = Provide client id for API access
client-secret = Provide client secret for API access

[debugger_credentials]
debugging-username = Provide debugging username to run cron jobs
debugging-password = Provide debugging password to run cron jobs

[mysql_credentials]
username = Provide db username to connect with database
password = Provide db password to connect with database
```

### Now to execute single test case follow the below steps:

1. Navigate to the root directory of the test UI automation project
2. Open `local_run.sh` and update the following variables:

```
# Set variables
PATH_TO_TEST="tests/CREATIVE/test_creatives.py" (This is the path of perticular test file)
TEST_CASE_NAME="test_dashboard_creative_copy_creative_to_another_user_banner" (This is the perticular test case name)
```

3. In the terminal, navigate to the root directory and run the script:

```commandline
bash local_run.sh
```

### Execute All Test Cases from a Specific Test File:

1. Navigate to the root directory of the test UI automation project
2. Open `local_run.sh` file and update the following variables:

```
# Set variables
PATH_TO_TEST="tests/CREATIVE/test_creatives.py" (This is the path of perticular test file)
TEST_CASE_NAME="" (Leave this variable empty)
```

3. In the terminal, navigate to the root directory and run the script:

```commandline
bash local_run.sh
```

### Execute All Test Cases from All Test Files:

1. Navigate to the root directory of the test UI automation project
2. Open `local_run.sh` file and update the following variables:

```
# Set variables
PATH_TO_TEST="" (Leave this variable empty)
TEST_CASE_NAME="" (Leave this variable empty)
```

3. In the terminal, navigate to the root directory and run the script:

```commandline
bash local_run.sh
```

## Local Debugging (PyCharm)

For generating run configurations run the following command to collect the list of available tests.

```
$ APPROLE_ROLE_ID={YOUR-VAULT-ROLE-ID} APPROLE_SECRET_ID={YOUR-VAULT-SECRET} python -m pytest --collect-only
```

Copy and format the output to `_tools/runconfig_generator/_test_list.txt` file.

Run the following script to generate run configurations:

```
$ APPROLE_ROLE_ID={YOUR-VAULT-ROLE-ID} APPROLE_SECRET_ID={YOUR-VAULT-SECRET} python _tools/runconfig_generator/runconfig_gen.py
```

Then copy them to your project run configurations folder.

```
$cp _tools/runconfig_generator/confs/* .idea/runConfigurations/
```

You'll be able to debug the tests from your IDE now with all the run configurations available.

**_In case facing any issue on the above steps just follow the following steps to make it manually_**

`Step 1: Click on the 'Add Configuration' button at the top right corner of your 'PyCharm'`

`Step 2: Now from the 'Run/Debug Configurations' pop up, click on the 'Edit configurations template' button`

`Step 3: Expand the 'Python tests' and select 'pytest' option -->  Now fill up the form with the help of following

Now it's all set for you!!!

**To run any specific test case, just set the cursor anywhere in the test case and press 'control+shift+R' to start
running it**
